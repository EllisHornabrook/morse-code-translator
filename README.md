# Morse Code Translator

This was created during a challenge set on the _nology course to create a fully functioning morse code translator within a given time limit. This project took roughly 3 hours to finish.

## How it was made

- I used HTML, SCSS and Vanilla Javascript to create this website.
- Every letter and number was given a value of their Morse translation, the input value is then split so that each character can be read and translated to their Morse value before being joined again.
